The room looks unusual. A computer with an old dot matrix printer and a stack of yellowed paper is standing on the floor right in the middle of the room, 
as if someone measured out its location. Next to it is a crumpled cushion, a saucer for cookies (which is obvious from the abundance of crumbs), 
    and a long-finished cup of tea (which is also obvious from a dried-up teabag). 
The floor and the    walls are covered with an even layer of sheets of paper with numbers on them. Red threads are 
            tretched over the paper.    It all looks like a spy movie.
